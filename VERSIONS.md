## 📚 Section 1: Bookshelf Hero

### **Version 1: Book Already on Screen (Initial)**
- **Behavior**: The portfolio book starts in the center of the viewport and performs an entrance scale/tilt towards the user, with the empty shelf slot visible behind it.
- **Git Commit Reference**: `14fadde` / `bd390f6`

### **Version 2: Book Comes Out of Shelf (Face-Forward Pull)**
- **Behavior**: The portfolio book starts in the middle shelf slot facing forward at reduced scale, then slides forward and enlarges.
- **Git Commit Reference**: `0d6ee29`

### **Version 3: Physical Shelf Row Integration (Spine-Outward → Rotates to Front)**
- **Behavior**: The book starts showing only its narrow spine in the shelf row, pulls forward, and rotates 90° to face the user.
- **Git Commit Reference**: `9aae53a`

### **Version 4: Front-Angle Display + 2s Pause**
- **Behavior**: Book displayed at front-angle, pauses for 2s, then glides forward.
- **Git Commit Reference**: `223dffb`

### **Version 5: Unified 3D Physical Book Object + Natural Distance**
- **Behavior**: Unified 3D box model with front cover visible on shelf.
- **Git Commit Reference**: `5f5635c`

### **Version 6: True Shelf-Docked Book**
- **Behavior**: Shelf-docked rotation test.
- **Git Commit Reference**: `0b8585e`

### **Version 7: Exact Shelf Docking (Left Spine Forward next to API Design & Spring Boot) (Current)**
- **Left Spine Facing Viewer**:
  - The **left spine** (rich burgundy leather, embossed gold bands, vertical gold title *"KRITIKA PANWAR • PORTFOLIO"*) faces the viewer directly (`rotationY: 90°`).
  - The white page edges are on the hidden side inside the shelf.
- **Exact Placement Beside API Design & Spring Boot**:
  - Mathematically anchored to the middle shelf ledge between `API Design` and `Spring Boot`.
  - Sits flush on the wooden shelf edge, matching the surrounding books' baseline and height (no floating, no clipping into top shelf).
- **Physical Pull-Out & 90° Rotation**:
  - Sits naturally in the shelf row for 1.8 seconds.
  - Slides forward along the Z-axis out from between `API Design` and `Spring Boot`.
  - Rotates from `90°` to `-8°` so the spine swings to the left and the front cover faces the viewer.
  - Settles in the center foreground at a comfortable distance (ample breathing room on all sides).
- **Git Commit Reference**: Current
